# Spectral backend

## Run backend locally

For the backend we are using fastapi. To start up the server locally run:

```bash
fastapi dev spectral/main.py
```

This will allow you to look at the autogenerated OpenAPI documentation at http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs and make calls to the api via http://127.0.0.1:8000/
