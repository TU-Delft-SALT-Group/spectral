# Spectral kernel

## Run kernel locally

For the kernel we are using uvicorn. To start up the server locally run:

```bash
uvicorn dev spectral/main.py
```

This will allow you to look at the autogenerated OpenAPI documentation at http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs and make calls to the api via http://127.0.0.1:8000/

### api keys

To be able to use the deepgram model for the endpoint api/transcription/{model}/{id} you must store an apikey from https://deepgram.com/ in a DG_KEY environment key as follows:

```
DG_KEY = <your_api_key>
```
