## About Spectral

In 2024, we were tasked by the Multimedia Computing (MMC) Group of TU Delft to create an application for conducting comparative analysis of speech. Despite several toolkits already available on the market, none of them were able to fully satisfy the group's needs. We took on the challenge of composing a more user-friendly, multi-functional speech analysis toolkit suitable for typical as well as atypical speech.

We believe that Spectral will be of significant help to all ASR researchers, which in turn makes it easier for specialists to help people in need!'
